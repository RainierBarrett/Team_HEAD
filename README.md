#A GIT STUDY GUIDE

Seciton 1: Starting Up Git
====

First of all, you'll want to make an account on [github.com](https://github.com). Once you've done that, make sure you've installed the appropriate git client on your computer. If you have Windows, you'll want to use git-scm. On Linux or Mac, you likely already have git installed out of the box. To check, you can run `man git`, `which git`, etc. If you don't have it, go ahead and install it via your favorite apt-like service.

Finally, before you begin using git, it will be useful to run a couple of initial setup commands, to make sure git knows who you are:
`git config --global user.email <your-email-address>` 
`git config --global user.name <your-git-username>`
